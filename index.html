<p>The Case-to-Test Ratio is the ratio of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the total number of PCR tests administered. If the number of cases is increasing due to increased testing, we expect this ratio to remain constant. A rising case-to-test ratio indicates accelerating spread of COVID-19 or insufficient testing.</p>
