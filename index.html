<h2>7-Day Average Daily Case Increases in Arizona &amp; Pima County</h2>
<p>Average daily case increases in Arizona and Pima County have rapidly increased since Memorial Day Weekend. Tuesday, June 23, had a record single-day case increase in Pima County (502) and Arizona (3,591).</p>
<p>Note that typically it takes 10-14 days to see the effects of major policy changes or events. This is due to both the incubation period of COVID-19 (median of 4-5 days between exposure and symptom onset according to the CDC) and the reporting lag for new case data (typically 4-7 days according to ADHS).</p>
<p>Average daily cases increases began to reliably increase beginning on May 29, which was 14 days following the expiration of stay at home orders in Arizona.</p>

<p>The Case-to-Test Ratio is the ratio of confirmed COVID-19 cases to the total number of PCR tests administered. If the number of cases is increasing due to increased testing, we expect this ratio to remain constant. A rising case-to-test ratio indicates accelerating spread of COVID-19 or insufficient testing.</p>

<h2>Key Hospital Metrics</h2>
<p>Hospital COVID-19 specific metrics have been rapidly trending up in the last 3 weeks across Arizona. Hospital in-patient bed usage is currently at 86% and ICU bed usage is at 87% statewide (note that beds in use include both COVID and non-COVID patients).</p>
